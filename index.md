 {% for page in site.blog %}
  
 - [{{page.title}}](./blog/{{page.slug}})
  
 {% endfor %}

Aside from working with actual engineers and managers, these two projects have given me the opportunity to use my current skills and attain new ones while working towards a product that helps the general public, my number one goal since I was a child.
